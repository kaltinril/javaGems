# javaGems
Simple bejeweled style game

## Description:
The gameboard consists of rows and columns.
Each spot on the board contains a "Gem".
These gems positions can be swapped 1 for 1 with adjacent gems.
The purpose of the game is to maximize points (Potentially create more complicated levels)

## Rules:
1. 3 or more gems need to be matched in a row (up/down or left/right)
2. If no more moves then the game is over (Optional, shuffle remaining?)
